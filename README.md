# Auvra ‚Äî Hormone Health Assessment App

Auvra is a mobile-friendly React web app designed to help women identify potential hormone imbalances based on a personalized survey, optional lab inputs, and menstrual cycle phase. Built with guidance from endocrinology, gynecology, and functional nutrition frameworks, Auvra empowers users with actionable insights and education about their hormone health.

## üöÄ Project Goal
To provide an accessible, user-friendly tool for women to:
- Assess hormone health using symptoms, cycle data, and lab results
- Understand possible hormone imbalances and their implications
- Receive personalized recommendations and educational resources

## üõ†Ô∏è Process & Architecture
- **User Flow:**
  1. Home page introduces Auvra and its purpose
  2. Users complete a 10-question hormone health survey (various input types)
  3. Optionally, users can enter lab values for deeper analysis
  4. Cycle phase is calculated based on user input
  5. Backend logic scores symptoms and integrates lab data for refined results
  6. Results page displays hormone assessment, explanations, confidence levels, conflicts, and recommendations
  7. Users can download their report as a PDF or send it to their email
  8. Option to retake the survey and start over

- **Tech Stack:**
  - React (functional components)
  - TypeScript
  - React Router
  - Plain CSS Modules for styling
  - `html2canvas` + `jsPDF` for PDF export
  - Vercel KV for data storage
  - Vercel serverless functions for API

- **Architecture:**
  - Logic is separated into `src/logic/hormones`
  - Types are centralized in `src/types`
  - Components are in `src/components`
  - Pages are in `src/pages`
